<p>
D3 basically uses SVG to create rich, interactive, animated visual displays.

<p>
SVG provides a lot of very powerful facilities.

<p>
We can create SVG via  an XML description, or programmatically via JavaScript.
D3 does the latter.

<p>
We can create SVG directly in R using the svg() graphics device,
or gridSVG().  But annotating the SVG elements created via the
svg() device is not-entirely straightforward.
Can use the SVGAnnotation package.

<p>
We could create the SVG elements directly in JavaScript.
But D3 provides a framework that gives us enormous control
but provides some assistance via a computational model.

<p>
We can also use D3 to create HTML elements in the DOM.

<p>
We have
<ol>
 <li>an HTML document,</lI>
 <li>CSS for appearance and also layout</li>
 <li>JavaScript code for creating the content and implementing event handlers</li>
 <li>data as JavaScript objects, often serialized from R or another language as JSON</li>
</ol>

<p>
We create the SVG elements programmatically.
Suppose we want a collection of points as circles.
We'll
<ol>
  <li>Create an SVG canvas</li>
  <li>Create points and position them at x, y coordinates (directly and using a scale)</li>
  <li>Color the points based on the value of a third variable</li>
  <li>Add axes</li>
  <li>Add a tooltip to each point</li>
  <li>Add an event handler for each point</li>  
</ol>

Then we add transitions to an updated set of values.
We also explore different layouts such as network displays and maps.


<h4>The Data</h4>
We'll use the simple mtcars data set.
We serialize these data to JavaScript  with
<pre>
cat("var dataset =",
     toJSON(cbind(mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt", "cyl", "hp")], type = rownames(mtcars)), byrow = TRUE, colNames = TRUE),
    ";", file = "simpleData.json")
</pre>


<h2>Basic Skeleton</h2>
We create an HTML document.
It has a top-level html element,
and within this both a head and body elements.

<h3>The HEAD</h3>
In the head, we load the d3 JavaScript code
and also set the character encoding:
<pre>
&lt;meta charset="utf-8">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="d3/d3.v3.js"></script>
</pre>

<p>
We will also load data that we have written from R as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) content.
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="simpleData.json"></script>
</pre>

<p>
We can add a title that will appear in the browser's tab also:
<pre>
&lt;title>Simple Scatter Plot&lt;/title>
</pre>


<h3>The BODY</h3>
The visible content of our document is quite simple
and only contains an SVG canvas.
We can create an SVG element either manually in the HTML document,
or we can programmatically create with JavaScript.
We'll do the latter .
We create a &lt;script> element in the body and add the JavaScript
code to that.
<p>
We use variables to store the height and width.
<pre>
var w = 600,
    h = 500;
</pre>

Then comes the D3 idiom.
We use the d3 object and call its select() method to get the
&lt;body> element in the DOM.
This returns an object and we then invoke its append() method
to create a new HTML element named SVG.
Then we set its width and  height:
<pre>
var svg = d3.select("body")
            .append("svg")
            .attr("width", w)
            .attr("height", h);
</pre>
We have assigned the SVG element object to the JavaScript variable named
<b>svg</b>.

<p>
Notice how D3 uses the chaining of commands.
The methods typically return an object that we want to use in the next step,
e.g., append() returns the new element and then we can set its attributes with .attr().

<p>
Next, we create the circles.
This introduces the key D3 concept of a selection.
"A selection is an array of elements pulled from the current document."
D3 uses CSS3 selectors to identify the elements of interest.
These include
<ul>
 <li> element name, e.g., p, body, div, a, img</li>
 <li> class name, e.g., .className, div.plot</li>
 <li> ids (identifiers), e.g., #idName</li>
 <li> attribute value, e.g.  "[src='foo.png']"
</ul>

<p>
We select all of the circle elements with
<pre>
d3.selectAll("circle")
</pre>
Curiously, there are no circles, so this returns an empty selection.
But then we connect this selection with our data.
This then causes the selection to recognize that there are fewer elements
(0) than in the data set and it creates an internal collection of which elements
will need to be created, specifically, one for each observation in the data set.
<p>
Next, we use the enter() method to apply code to each of these "new" elements.
We do this with
<pre>
svg.selectAll("circle")
    .data(dataset)
    .enter()
    .append("circle")
    .attr("r", 4)
    .attr("cx", function(d, i) {
                   return( i * w/dataset.length + 5 );
                })
    .attr("cy", h/2)
    .attr("fill", "red");
</pre>
Here we are creating a circle via <code>append("circle")</code>.
This and the .attr() calls are applied to each of the elements
in the selection.  These are the new elements created by the call to enter().
We are specifying the cx and cy attributes to position each circle,
and setting the radius and color to constants.

<p>
Note that because we are using D3 selections, we don't need explicit for() loops!
This reminds us of R, but is due to very different reasons.

<p>
The interesting part is setting the cx attribute.
This is different for each circle so we use a function to compute the
value for each circle.
The function needs the data, and in our simple case, the index of
the observation.
We define our function to take 2 parameters (d and i) and
D3 passes the observation/row via d and  the index via i.


<p>
The result is visible in <a href="scatter1.html" >scatter1.html</a>.

<h3>Positioning  the Points by Weight (wt) and Miles Per Gallon (mpg)</h3>

The only part of the code we need to change is the computation of cx and cy.
We might like to use
<pre>
    .attr("cx", function(d, i) {
                   return d.wt;
                })
    .attr("cy", function(d) {
                  return d.mpg;
                })
</pre>
The code runs, but does not do what we want.
These values are in units of 1000s of pounds and miles per (US) gallon.
They are not values of pixels.
So we have to transform them.
This is relatively straightforward.
For the horizontal values, we compute the minimum and maximum of wt.
Then we create a linear mapping from this range to the width of the SVG canvas, <b>w</b>.
<p>
(We could have calculated the minimum and maximum in R and serialized that also. But we don't need
to.)
<p>
D3 provides facilities for calculating the min and max:
<pre>
d3.min(dataset, function(d) d.wt)
d3.max(dataset, function(d) d.wt)
</pre>
If dataset were a simple array, we wouldn't need the function.
The function is to extract the relevant variable/column from each row.
<p>
So we could write the computations as
<pre>
var wt_range = [d3.min(dataset, function(d) d.wt), d3.max(dataset, function(d) d.wt)];
var mpg_range = [d3.min(dataset, function(d) d.mpg), d3.max(dataset, function(d) d.mpg)];


    .attr("cx", function(d, i) {
                   return w*(d.wt - wt_range[0])/(wt_range[1] - wt_range[0]);
                })
    .attr("cy", function(d) {
                   return h * (1 - (d.mpg - mpg_range[0])/(mpg_range[1] - mpg_range[0]));
                })
</pre>
Note that for the vertical value, we do something slightly different.
For us, as miles per gallons increase, the points will appear further up the window.
However, computer graphics (SVG included) typically use 0,0 as the top left corner
and increasing values go down the window!
So larger values of would be further down the window.
We want them to go the other way, corresponding to  a vertical axis starting at the bottom of the
                   window.
So we compute h*(1 - proportion along the scale)
<p>

The result is in <a href="scatter2.html" >scatter2.html</a>.

<h3>Scales</h3>
Instead of doing the computations manually, we can use scale objects in D3.
This is not vital here, but it is useful generally. See projections for maps
and also non-linear scales.
They will also simplify creating axes for our plot.
<p>
We create a scale with d3.scale.linear(), using the ranges for the variables we computed above:
<pre>
var wtScale = d3.scale.linear().domain(wt_range).range([0, w]);  // make certain to put these into an array. not two arguments
var mpgScale = d3.scale.linear().domain(mpg_range).range([h, 0]); 
</pre>
We specify the input and the output as domain and range,
making certain to pass an array.
Note that we made the mpgScale go from h to 0 rather than 0 to h.
This ensures large values of mpg will be small in this new scale
and so closer to the top of the window.
<p>

These scales are just computational devices; they don't show anything.
We use them to calculate the values for the cx and cy attributes.
d3.scale.linear() and friends return a function which we can call.
So we set cx with
<pre>
 .attr("cx", function(d) {
                return wtScale (d.wt) ;
             })
</pre>

<p>
See <a href="scatter3.html" >scatter3.html</a>

<p>
Note that a D3 scale has  several methods that make them more convenient
and polished, e.g., nice, ticks, tickFormat.


<p>
We could add text to the plot at each circle using another D3 selection.
We don't add the text to the circle elements.
Instead, we loop over the observations again and create new &lt;text> elements, 
e.g.,
<pre>
svg.selectAll("text")
   .data(dataset)
   .enter()
   .append("text")
   .text(function(d) {
            // some label
         })
</pre>


<h3>Axes</h3>
The next step is to add horizontal and vertical axes.
We use <code>d3.svg.axis()</code> to create an axis.
We connect it to a scale object and then we use the d3 method call()
to initialize the axis.
It is also convenient to append the axis within a new &lt;g> element
so that all the lines and labels are part of a single group.
We can also then position that group, and hence all the elements in the axis,
in a single transformation.
We can do this with
<pre>
var wtAxis = d3.svg.axis()
                  .scale(wtScale)
                  .orient("bottom"); // where the labels appear

    svg.append("g")
       .attr("transform", "translate(0, " + (h - padding/2.0) + ")")
       .call(wtAxis);
</pre>
The transform attribute is an SVG attribute that allows us to perform
several different types of transformations.
In this case, we move the group object 0 pixels in the horizontal direction,
and h - padding/2 units down the canvas.

<p>
The wtAxis object is a function, again.
The call(wtAxis) arranges to invoke the function with the current selection
that comes from the earlier link in the chain.

<p>
The D3 axis object has methods to suggest the number of tick marks, compute the
labels for the tick marks, etc.

<p>
The result is in <a href="scatter4.html" >scatter4.html</a>

<p>
The axis is not very pretty. We want to style it better.
We can do this with CSS. We set the properties on the
SVG elements. We need to identify these.
We can use the developer tools and its inspector to find
the class that D3 puts on the different elements,
e.g. "tick major", "domain".
<p>
Alternatively, we can assume control and do this by adding an identifier or a class on the
axis. We set this on the &lt;g> containing the axis,
and the properties will be inherited by the children.
So we can do this with
<pre>
svg.append("g")
   .attr("class", "axis horizontal")
   .attr("transform", "translate(0, " + (h - padding/2.0) + ")")
   .call(wtAxis);
</pre>
<p>
Then we can set the properties with
<pre>
.axis line, .axis path {
  fill: none;
  stroke: blue;
}
</pre>


<p>
Add a vertical axis to this plot in <a href="scatter4.html" >scatter4.html</a>

<h3>Tooltips</h3>
One approach to creating tooltips for elements in SVG is to add
a title attribute to each &lt;circle>.
We'll add the type of car as the tooltip:
<pre>
.attr("title", function(d) {
                  return d.type;
               });
</pre>

The result is in <a href="scatter5.html" >scatter5.html</a>.
<p>
There are other richer ways to create tooltips.




<h3>Event Handlers</h3>
Tooltips react to user interaction, but just pausing the pointer over an object.
We also want to be able to provide more detailed interactions,
e.g., clicking on an element, using keys, dragging an object.
We can do this with the on() method for an object.
Suppose we want to a click on a circle in the plot
to display content about the observation in
a separate part of the HTML document.
We can do this with
<pre>
svg.selectAll("circle")
    .data(dataset)
    .enter()
    .append("circle")
    .on("click", function(d) {
                   displayObservation(d)
                 });
</pre>
This calls a (yet to be defined) function displayObservation()
to add the contents of the observation to, e.g., a table.

<p>
We define this function as
<pre>
function displayObservation(obs)
{

    var el = document.getElementById('observation');
    
    var tbl =  '&lt;table>' +
       '&lt;tr>&lt;th>Type&lt;/th>&lt;td>' + obs.type + '&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>' +
       '&lt;tr>&lt;th>MPG&lt;/th>&lt;td>' + obs.mpg + '&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>' +
       '&lt;tr>&lt;th>Weight&lt;/th>&lt;td>' + obs.wt + '&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>' +
	'&lt;/table>';

     el.innerHTML = tbl;
}
</pre>
<p>
For this to work,
we create an empty &lt;div> element
in our HTML document and give it an <b>id</b> attribute <i>observation</i>.


<p>
The result is in <a href="scatter6.html" >scatter6.html</a>.

<p>
The names of the common events are 
click, mouseover, mouseout.
However, there are other events and we and others can create new ones.
For example, for the package network display, the force layout mechanism
for the graph has a <i>tick</i> event.

<p>
The callback functions get the observation and the index as with our other
functions in the selection.
The function also has access to the element on which the event occurred
via the <b>this</b> global variable.

<p>
Additionally, we can get the actual event object with <code>d3.event</code>.


<h3>Coloring the Points</h3>
We want to set a color on each circle corresponding to the horse power (hp)
variable.
We can use a D3 scale to map the value of hp to a color.
We start by including another JavaScript file in the head of the HTML document:
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="d3-devel/lib/colorbrewer/colorbrewer.js"></script>
</pre>
This brings in several of Cyndy Brewer's  color palettes, the same as the RColorBrewer package in R.

<p>
In our JavaScript code, we create a scale to map hp to colors with
<pre>
var color = d3.scale.quantize()
                .domain([d3.min(dataset, function(d) d.hp), d3.max(dataset, function(d) d.hp)])
                .range(colorbrewer.RdBu[5]);
</pre>
RdBu is one of the color palettes.
We specified the min and max for the horsepower and then the scale divides
the output into equal width buckets corresponding to 5 different colors.
<p>
See - scales are useful!

<p>
Q: How would we add a legend?
<p>
Q:  Add the horse power to the tooltip.

<h2>Observation and Debugging Developer Tools</h2>
Browser's developer tools.

<h2>CSV Files</h2>
We serialized the data we have used in our examples
from R directly into JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
Then we referenced that code with a &lt;script> element in
the head (or the body) element of the HTML document.
This meant that the dataset was immediately available to
us in the form we expected.
<p>
In other cases, we may have the data in a CSV file or JSON file or whatever.
In this case, we need JavaScript code to read the data from that file
and transform it into a suitable form for us to use.
D3 provides functions for read from common data formats:
 d3.csv(), d3.json(), d3.xml(), d3.html()
There is also a d3.xhr() function for making XML-HTTP requests to get results
directly from a Web server.
<p>
The important aspect of using these functions is that they take time.
We rarely put the code to read the data in the &lt;head> of the HTML document.
Instead, we put it in the body.
But as the JavaScript is reading the data, it blocks the processing of the rest of the page.
This is undesirable.
Instead, we use asynchronous loading.
Basically, we say, "start retrieving and reading the data in one thread, but keep going with
processing the document. Then, when you have all the data, do something with it".
We do this by providing a "callback" function in the call to, e.g., d3.csv().
<pre>
d3.csv('data.csv', function(error, dataset) {
                      // process the data, e.g., selectAll().data(dataset).enter()
                   })
</pre>
We would put the <code>selectAll("elName").data(dataset).enter()</code>
in this function as  that is when we have the data to bind to the elements.


<h2>Changing the Data</h2>
<p>
When the values of the data change, we want to update the plot.
We are not concerned with how the data change.
This might be due to updating a frequency table or distribution
with new data, the viewer interacting with the page and explicitly
change the data. For now, we'll assume the number of observations stays the same.

<p>
Basically, when we change the data, we rebind it to the elements
in almost the same way we did to create the elements using the
<code>.data(dataset).enter().append("elName")...</code>.
When we update the data, we don't call enter() and append().
Instead, we just rebind the new values with
<code>selection.data(dataset)</code>
and then follow this by updating the attributes on the
SVG elements based on the new values in the dataset,
e.g., the cx and cy and fill values.
<p>
For example, suppose that the values in <b>dataset</b>
have changed (or that we have a new dataset and assigned it to <b>dataset</b> but with the same
number of elements).
We can rebind the new dataset to the elements in the following manner for our
scatterplot:
<pre>
 svg.selectAll("circle")
      .data(dataset)
      .attr("r", 4)
      .attr("cx", function(d) {
            return wtScale (d.wt) ;
         })
      .attr("cy", function(d) {
            return mpgScale(d.mpg) ;
         })
</pre>
This is the same code as we used before, but without the <code>.enter().append()</code>.
Note that we may have to update the wtScale and mpgScale to
change its domain appropriately.

<h4>Transitions</h4>
Smooth transitions when the data change (for whatever reason!)
can help draw the viewers attention to particular features.
D3 helps us with this via the transition() method
and also the duration() method that controls how long the transition takes.
Before we update the attributes, but just after we rebind the data,
we can call transition() and that causes D3 to animate the change
from previous value to the new value for each element.
The only change to the code above is
<pre>
 svg.selectAll("circle")
      .data(dataset)<font color="red">
      .transition()
      .duration(2000) // 1000 is the default, so this is slower</font>
      .attr("r", 4)
      .attr("cx", function(d) {
            return wtScale (d.wt) ;
         })
      .attr("cy", function(d) {
            return mpgScale(d.mpg) ;
         })
</pre>
We added the calls to transition() and also duration().
Duration controls how long the interval is.
The default is 1000 milliseconds. We can increase or decrease this.
The .ease() method controls the speed over the duration of the animation.
By default, D3 starts slowly, speeds up, and the slows down for the end.
There are several other schems.
<p>
We can speciy a delay for the transition via .delay().
We would use a function for the argument to this in the usual way:
<pre>
.delay(function(d, i) { })
</pre>
This allows us to have a different delay for each observation/element.


<p>
Importantly, we have to update the axis, not just the scale.
(The axis is the visible representation of the scale.)
We can do this with
<pre>
  svg.select(".axis.horizontal").call(wtAxis);
</pre>
To do this, we needed to be able to select the &lt;g> element
that contains the axis.  We can use the class we gave to it.

<p>
We can also animate the transition for colors.


<p>
If we need to update derived statistical results when the data
change, we may need R's functionality.
However, at viewing time, R is not present.
We can do some compuations in JavaScript.
However, this is where generally we want R around.
Shiny or other approaches are useful here.
See <a href="#DynComps" >Dynamic Computations</a>.


<h3>Changing the Number of Observations</h3>


<h2>Network Graph</h2>
See <a href="packageGraph.html" >packageGraph.html</a>
and
<a href="packageGraph2.html" >packageGraph2.html</a>.
<p>
The first shows how to create a force layout network display.
The second extends this.
The data come from R packages installed on my computer and
the relationships between which package imports another package.
We compute this information via the code in <a href="pkgDepends.R" >pkgDepends.R</a>.
This generates the data for the "graph" and other purposes in various different forms
and also serializes these to JSON.

<p>
The second version color codes the nodes based on whether
they have no author, Duncan as the author, or other.
It also registers an event handler on the nodes so that
when a viewer clicks on a node, we display information about that package in another
part of the HTML document


<p>
Another example is a force-directed network showing
which routines call which other routines in a C file,
specifically R's src/main/memory.c.
<a href="callGraph1.html" >Here's the display</a>.
The nodes have tooltips to identify the routine.


<p>
Another way to view these dependencies is with a wheel-dependency.
For example,
<a href="packageDependency.html" >packageDependency.html</a>.
This uses the DependencyWheel  code built on top of D3.
The Git repository  is at <a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/DependencyWheel.git" >https://github.com/fzaninotto/DependencyWheel.git</a>.


<h2>Trees</h2>
The following illustrates a hierarchical tree layout:
<a href="XMLBookIncludes.html" >XMLBookIncludes.html</a>
<p>
There are also circular tree layouts.




<h2>Maps</h2>
There is a good 
description of
creating a reasonably involved map at <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/"
>http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/</a>,
written by D3's creator Mike Bostock.
There are simpler examples in the <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/" >git repository</a> for the book
<i>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</i>.

<h2 ><a name="DynComps">Dynamic Computations</a></h2>
Performing statistical computations at viewing time?
No R.
Shiny.
But regular R plots will not be interactive.
Have to generate interactive plots from R.
Can do this. Or can get results back from R and then use these to draw in D3.


<h2>R D3-Graphics Device</h2>
Can we generate D3 code from R graphics?
Yes, we can implement a graphics device
like pdf(), svg(), png()
that converts calls to create circles, lines, text, etc.
into D3 code.
See RD3Device and the RGraphicsDevice package generally.
<p>
Here <a href="showPlot.html" >is an example</a> of a simple output from R graphics
rendered directly with D3.
<p>
This is similar to create SVG. We still have to annotate it.
